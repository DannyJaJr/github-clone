![Github logo](https://www.zbw-mediatalk.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/github-cover.jpg)

The goal of this lab is to build a clone of your Github profile using React. 

We only want you to use `functional components` for this app. 

The following are required to be implemented with this lab
- [ ] `useState`
- [ ] `useEffect`
- [ ] `Axios` for getting data back from Github's API ( need to install )
- [ ] `props` to pass data down to a component
- [ ] Use `react-router-dom` for routing to different components ( need to install )

`1` Fork and clone repo.

`2` Start app to make sure that it is working
```text
npm start
```

With this lab, you need to need to make the following components:

## `1` `Dashboard`

## `2` `Explore`

## `3` `Settings`

`1` With the settings page, make a form that will update some of the settings.

## `4` `Repositories` (username)

### Tips

`1` When you're on a page, you need take a moment for each page to write down each item that you see a specific page. That information will be needed to make each component.

`2` Refer to `resources` to help you.
