# `Github Clone`

This is a Github Clone built in React

The goal of this lab is to make a clone of your Github profile using React. We only want you to use `functional components` for this app. 
`1` Fork and clone repo.

With this lab, you need to need to make the following components:
- Respositories
- Explore
- Settings
- romebell (profile)

When you're on a page, you need take a moment for each page to write down each item on the specific page. That information will be needed to make each component.
